## Learning Objectives

The learning goals for this module are:

* Discuss the non-seasonal ARIMA class of models for stationary series and its variations (AR, MA and ARMA); <br>
* Understand the main differences between autoregressive and moving average component; <br>
* Understand the unit root condition for stationarity; <br>
* Learn how to fit non-seasonal ARIMA models in R. <br>

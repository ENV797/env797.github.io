## Learning Objectives
The learning goals for this module are:

* Understand the concept of scenario generation;
* Connect optimization and decision making under uncertainty (stochastic optimization);
* Learn how to represent uncertainty with a scenario tree;
* Learn how to generate correlated scenarios when trying to forecast more than one variable;
* Learn how to generate scenarios based on the time series models we learned in R.

## Slides

Here is a <a href="/docs/modules/PPTS/TSA_S24_M11_ScenarioGeneration.pdf" > link </a> to the slide deck used in class.

## Resources

* Example of application of state space linear models and scneario generation to <a href="/docs/modules/PPTS/TSA_S24_M11_HTSP_ApplicationStateSpaceModels.pdf" > inflow forecasting </a>.

## Recordings

This module is explained in three videos that go over the slides shared and how to generate scenarios in R.

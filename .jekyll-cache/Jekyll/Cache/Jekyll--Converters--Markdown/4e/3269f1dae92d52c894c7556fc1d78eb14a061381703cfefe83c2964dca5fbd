  <li>(OPTIONAL) We will be using the https protocol to clone repositories. Another option is to use SSH keys, which is a more secure option. For a guide on how to generate your own SSH key(s), see the guide from the Duke Library: https://git-rfun.library.duke.edu/outline.html.</li>

<h2 id="latex">LaTeX</h2>
<p>LaTeX will be used by RStudio and the R package <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Knitr</code> to convert our RMarkdown files (.Rmd) into professional-quality PDF files. 
If you do not have LaTeX installed on your computer, please do the following:</p>

<p><strong>On a PC</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install Basic MiKTeX: http://miktex.org/download.</li>
  <li>Note: you need to use the MiKTeX package manager to download required style guides.</li>
</ol>

<p>By default, RStudio uses style guides to format our PDF documents. 
These style guides include framed.sty and titling.sty.
We have found that not all LaTeX installations include these style guides.
If you do not have them, you will get an error message when you “Knit”.
To fix this, you need to install the required files.</p>

<p><strong>On a PC</strong>:
You have two options:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the MikTeX package manager from Start.</li>
    <li>
      <p>Search for and install the following: framed, titling</p>

      <p>OR</p>
    </li>
    <li>Type the following in command line (or GitBash):
      <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mpm <span class="nt">--install</span> framed
mpm <span class="nt">--install</span> titling
</code></pre></div>      </div>
    </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>If your RMarkdown documents are not knitting properly, try the following troubleshooting option: 
Go to the Start menu, find the menu “MiKTeX Console”, and choose the option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Always install missing packages on-the-fly</code></p>
